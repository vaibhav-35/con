  * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
  * listed below.
  *
  * Any CSS (and SCSS, if configured) file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, or any plugin's
  * vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
  *
  * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
  * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any other CSS
  * files in this directory. Styles in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
  * It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.
